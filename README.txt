A quick script to check the shim values from DICOMs off of Siemens 3T Skyra scanner.

After I ran into some data quality issues with some of my fMRI scans I needed to check the shim values from many different images from all of my participants. With some quick editing in the compile_dicom.m script you should output a csv of shim values for all your scans.
